/**
 * This ruleset defines the security model for the "Whisper Rooms" application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is built on two primary patterns: strict user-ownership for private
 * data and creator-ownership for publicly readable data. This ensures a clear separation
 * between personal user information and shared application content. The default posture
 * is to deny all access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is organized into two top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private UserProfile documents. Access is strictly limited
 *   to the authenticated owner of the document.
 * - /rooms/{roomId}: Stores Room documents that are publicly readable by any client,
 *   but writable only by the user who created them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Privacy: Listing users from the top-level /users collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to prevent user enumeration and protect privacy.
 * - Public Discoverability: The /rooms collection is publicly readable to allow
 *   users to browse and discover available voice chat rooms.
 * - Creator Control: Write access (update, delete) to any room is restricted to its
 *   original creator, ensuring content integrity.
 * - Authorization Independence: Room documents contain a denormalized 'creatorId' field.
 *   This avoids costly and slow 'get()' calls to other documents during rule evaluation,
 *   making authorization checks fast and efficient.
